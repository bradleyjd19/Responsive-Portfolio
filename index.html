      <p>Joshua Bradley is a resourceful laboratory professional and aspiring Full Stack Developer with over eleven years of experience in the fields of Histology and Microbiology. For the past six years, he served as the Clinical Lab Supervisor in Histology at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, MO. In this capacity, Mr. Bradley was responsible for the oversight of all laboratory operations, the management of personnel, and ensuring the delivery of quality lab results in a timely and efficient manner.</p>

      <p>During his tenure at Children's Mercy, Mr. Bradley recognized an opportunity to simplify and increase the efficiency of tracking multiple daily measurement logs through the use of a mobile application. After several unsuccessful attempts to find one that would suit the needs of the laboratory, he decided to try to build one himself. With a rudimentary understanding of HTML and CSS, and the help of the online application builder, Bubble.is, he was able to create a program with very basic formatting and functionality. He found the building process so intriguing that he decided to give up his decade-long career in Health Sciences to pursue a new life in the world of full-stack development.<p>
